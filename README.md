# Unified User Touch Application Integration Model - API

The last 5 years has seen amazing improvments in  server hardware and software environments for all Operating Systems and all modern platforms. Commercial and Open; our toolset and resources have grown exponentally.

# On the Desktop, 
uh Well, not much has changed, few new features, Perhaps commercially we have some of the features of the phone on the desktop, and vise versa. But we still do not have a way for all applications to have access to everything they need to develop fully featured resposive multitouch applications.

# Touch works - Gestures and Collaboritave Workflows are Lacking Miserably - Let's fix this

Are we going somewhere?

Calling all developers, engineers, and designers: Debian, BSD, H-linux, Darwin, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, pidora, PBXinaBox, Windows, ROSA Linux, Hanna Montana Linux, Fried Chicken Linux, whatever.

From all Industries: Banking, Intelligence Gathering, Finance, IOT, Comsumer Electronic Manufacturers, Television Manufacturers, Tablet Manufacturers, Business Intelligence, Aeronautics, Industrial Controls, Automotive Integration, Software Development,  Network Operations, Foodservice, Crypto, Audio, Video, Lighting, Theater Operations. YOU NAME IT!

If you use a computer, we need your input. GitHub is the only way to do it.

This Github Master should be forked, branched, and eventually unified into a common API for all operating systems. To unify the touch experience with the human computer interaction requirements of our ideaset.  

I will take lead for now:
# My name is Hilaire Francis Nollette III
If you were at #SCALE14x I was the Audio Engineer in the Keynote Room, I am glad I was there, otherwise, I don't think the skillset whould have been there to pull of that level of production.

It is unification, convergence and community, building an Open Source Product - To Deliver a Solution for all Computer users.

Lets talk about how we fund the infrastructure, monitize certain aspects, and how create the infrastructre to have such the High Level multi-everything-everybody-community model that will be created through our collective efforts. It will be amazing.

This will be the largest, most diverse, most complex open-source project ever attempted.
Canonical could do it, Microsoft could do it. 
I believe the whole community would be much happer if the energy was taken to pull resources and skillsets from across the entire open-source communtity.

I am the Poll Master, I will be creating polls and serveys, collecting data about touch and human user touch intereraction targeting both end-users, and developers will collect their own data based on that input, and ask for more. That data will be public-domain. 

We need the UI/UX and desktop devs from each and all major mainline distrobution. 
We need to take the very best elements of User Interface Design from every GUI ever created, and incorporate that into a completly new way of using a computer. 

We need artists. 

I have a ton of ideas, with no way of implementing them. 
I can bash script all day, I can put up a well designed responsive data driven website. I can record audio, video, or a dozen types of straming data and save it to a plethora of encodings and continer formats, and I know how those formats work. I can sucessfully spin up resources on Cloud Services Providers and make those talk across different availability zones. 

What I cannot do; is do it all (the way I want) with a touchscreen.

As a child My favorite television show was "Star Trek - The Next Generation." I still love the franchize, and make it a point to see new releases in theaters running actual film. None of the pixelated (I didn't say I could see the pixels, but knowing they are there is a psychological trip for me. I am also really impressed with the 4K technology. Can't wait to see 8k in a massive form factor {with touch} ) LCARS http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/LCARS is the dream.

LCARS: The Library Computer Access and Retrieval System, was designed with an artist's perspective, and it didn't have to work.

We actually have to make #LCARS work. 

Until I write more:

We, together will create the community to create the best way to do multitouch. And I will show you how.
