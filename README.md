# Unified User Touch Application Integration Model - API

The last 5 years has seen amazing improvments in  server hardware and software environments for all Operating Systems and all modern platforms. Commercial and Open; our toolset and resources have grown exponentally.

# On the Desktop, 
uh Well, not much has changed, few new features, Perhaps commercially we have some of the features of the phone on the desktop, and vise versa. But we still do not have a way for all applications to have access to everything they need to develop.

# Touch works - Gestures and Collaboritave Workflows are Lacking Miserably - Let's fix this

# In comes me @sacmt-hciie : Self Appointed Curator of Multiuser Touch - Human Community Information Integration Educator

Are we going somewhere?

Calling all developers, engineers, and designers: Debian, BSD, H-linux, Darwin, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, pidora, PBXinaBox, Windows, ROSA Linux, Hanna Montana Linux, Fried Chicken Linux, whatever.

From all Industries: Banking, Intelligence Gathering, Finance, IOT, Comsumer Electronic Manufacturers, Television Manufacturers, Tablet Manufacturers, Business Intelligence, Aeronautics, Industrial Controls, Automotive Integration, Software Development,  Network Operations, Foodservice, Crypto, Audio, Video, Lighting, Theater Operations. YOU NAME IT!

If you use a computer, we need your input. GitHub is the only way to do it.

This Github Master should be forked, branched, and eventually unified into a common API for all operating systems. To unify the touch experience with the human computer interaction requirements of our ideaset.  

I will take lead for now:
# My name is Hilaire Francis Nollette III
If you were at #SCALE14x I was the Audio Engineer in the Keynote Room, I am glad I was there, otherwise, I don't think the skillset whould have been there to pull of that level of production.

It is unification, convergence and community, building an Open Source Product - To Deliver a Solution for all Computer users.

Lets talk about how we fund the infrastructure, monitize certain aspects, and how create the infrastructe to have such the High Level multi-everything-everybody-community model. It will be amazing.

Until I write more:

We, together will create the community to create the best way to do multitouch. And I will show you how.
